UTN NLU Lab Website
============================

The website is built using Jekyll with a modified version of the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

It makes use of:
 - [Bootstrap@v4.6.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
 - [Fontawesome@v6.7.1](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
 - [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)

Our website is a fork of the UTN Data System Lab's website, who did most of the programming work (https://utndatasystems.github.io/). 

This website is a work in progress and there is currently not a setup for local development, although opening the .html-files in a browser works alright. Visit the gh-pages branch to see and edit the pages. The website will be re-deployed automatically shortly after changes are pushed.
